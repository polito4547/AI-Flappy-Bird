This was originally a school project, below is the original README file that goes over what is to be expected from the program, as well as what aspects we were graded on. Additionally, there is a link to a video that we had to make, showing that the program was indeed working.

## Directions

In this project, you decide your individual programming adventure in consolation with me. You will need to design a program that utilizes the elements learned in class. This will be a challenge as there will be no demo versions and if you want unit tests, you will need to design them.

This project is intended for students who want a challenge of their choosing.

## Program Description

In this project, I will create an AI that plays Flappy Bird. As the AI loses, it should be able to adjust its parameters in order to get farther into the game.
In order to create the game, I will use PyGame as it contains many of the functions needed to have the game coded as effeciently as possible.
NEAT-python will be used as the AI part of this project. It will use a properties text to set the initial parameters of the AI and a visualization python file where
all of the fuctions manipulate the data from the properties file, as well as handling all of the objects in game.

## Rubric / Grading Scale

* Working program per the above program description
  * Game file (20 pt)
  * Visualization file (20 pt)
  * NEAT Parameters (10 pt)

Total Points: 50

### Additional Grading Notes

* Programmers must have attention to detail, as a result up to __2 Points__ may be taken for not updating the student info (Name, CRN, Semester Year) in the __Markdown__ and __Python Comments__.
* Customers will not pay for programs that do not work, as a result up to __50 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not run due to syntax errors.
* Programmers tend to forget how large programs work over time, as a result up to __4 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not have a _reasonable_ amount of comments that describe key sections of code.
* Minimum of 4 or more commits made to GitHub showing incremental programming changes towards the final program (4pt)
  * 1 Commit may be for updating Student Info in the Markdown and Python File
  * 3 Commits must be for programming updates to source code
  * If a unit test is available, no changes made to the Unit Test will count towards the required commits (nor should there be any changes made to this file).
  * This is a team project, all group members must have at least one commit with code changes. Updating student info does not count.
* All programs must have your Github URL submitted in Canvas via the assignment page. Unsubmitted Github repos will receive __0 Points__.
* Programs that have been submitted and received a grade will not be regraded, unless the instructor makes a request for changes.
* If a program is eligible for regrading, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor when the program is ready for regrading.
